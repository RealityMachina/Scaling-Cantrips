{
  "CasterLevelsReq": 2, // this is how many caster levels is needed before we get additional damage dice for each step. Default is two caster levels for a new damage dice. (So 2d3 at Level 2 Wizard, 3d3 at Level 4 Wizard, 4d3 at Level 6 wizard, etc)
  "MaxDice": 6, // this is the max amount of damage dice we're allowed to have for cantrips. By default, this caps out at 6d3.
  "DisruptCasterLevelsReq": 3, //disrupt undead values, works like the above except Disrupt Undead uses D6
  "DisruptMaxDice": 4,
  "VirtueCasterLevelsReq": 2, // works similarly to other cantrips, except Virtue's about temporary HP. Level 2 caster grants 2 temp HP, Level 4 caster is 3 temp HP, etc.

  "DisruptLifeLevelsReq": 2,

  "DontAddFirebolt": false, //WOTR patch added vanilla equivalent, let this be toggled on for people who don't want duplicates
  "StartImmediately": true //default "true" means caster rank calculations assume One plus (caster level ) divided by (levelsreq), so with default settings: 2nd caster level at level 2 means 2d3.
  //If set to false, it uses Start plus Div Step, whose formula is 1 +( (caster level - start level) / levels req ). Start levels for cantrips are set to be level 2.
  // so still with default settings, it takes until level 3 before we get 2d3, since then the formula is 1 + ((3 - 2) / 2), which gives us two instead of one. (The game puts in a zero if the latter side of the formula goes into the negatives)
